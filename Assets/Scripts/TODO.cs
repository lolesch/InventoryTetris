/// TODO

// fix the item drop positioning
// -> the offset is fine once the drop includes the items dimensions
// atm. the item is dropped in the surrounding slots dependent on the mouse offset to the center of the hovered slot.
// this offset needs to be calculated in relation to the center of the drag display

// fix offhand and second ring slot interaction (can equip but can't unequip/select)

// fix equiping 2h + 1h => unequip offhands when equiping a 2H

// rework all to support AbstractItems instead of AbstractItemObjects => AbstractItemObjects contain an AbstractItem

// compare rings and weapons to both slots

/// POLISH

// Sockets?
// Any weapon except throwing weapons.
// Any body armor.
// Any shields.
// Any headgear.

// Improved MagicFind:
// Effective MF = (MF * Factor) / (MF + Factor), where Factor=250 for unique items, 500 for set items and 600 for rare items..
