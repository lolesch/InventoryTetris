///
// fix the item drop positioning
// -> the offset is fine once the drop includes the items dimensions
// atm. the item is dropped in the surrounding slots dependent on the mouse offset to the center of the hovered slot.
// this offset needs to be calculated in relation to the center of the drag display

// loot generation

// rework all to support AbstractItems instead of AbstractItemObjects => AbstractItemObjects contain an AbstractItem
