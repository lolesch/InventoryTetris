// TODO

// fix the item drop positioning
// -> the offset is fine once the drop includes the items dimensions
// atm. the item is dropped in the surrounding slots dependent on the mouse offset to the center of the hovered slot.
// this offset needs to be calculated in relation to the center of the drag display

// rework all to support AbstractItems instead of AbstractItemObjects => AbstractItemObjects contain an AbstractItem

// keep item preview within the screen
// -> anchor the preview based on the cursor relative position to the screen center so that it always points towards the center
// -> the item comparison should follow these rulez

// preview possible item stat ranges
